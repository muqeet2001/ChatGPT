        "1. Decimal System:\n",
        "The decimal system, also known as the base-10 system, is the number system we use in our everyday lives. It consists of ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Each digit has a place value, which determines its position in a number. The rightmost digit represents ones, the next digit represents tens, the next hundreds, and so on. For example, in the number 456, the digit 4 represents 400, the digit 5 represents 50, and the digit 6 represents 6.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Binary System:\n",
        "The binary system, also known as the base-2 system, is commonly used in computer science and digital electronics. It consists of only two digits: 0 and 1. Each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2. The rightmost digit represents 2^0 (which is 1), the next digit represents 2^1 (which is 2), the next 2^2 (which is 4), and so on. For example, the binary number 1010 represents (1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10 in the decimal system.\n",

        "3. Hexadecimal System:\n",
        "The hexadecimal system, also known as the base-16 system, is commonly used in computer programming and digital systems. It consists of sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. The first ten digits are the same as in the decimal system, and the remaining six are represented by letters A to F. Each digit in a hexadecimal number represents a power of 16. The rightmost digit represents 16^0 (which is 1), the next digit represents 16^1 (which is 16), the next 16^2 (which is 256), and so on. For example, the hexadecimal number 2F represents (2 * 16^1) + (15 * 16^0) = 32 + 15 = 47 in the decimal system.\n",
